# quorum-auction
Simple auction dApp built on Quorum blockchain with Java.

## This has constellation of 5 nodes but we are using only three nodes for our dApp i.e. node A, B and C.
### In the functionality, a simple smart contract is already deployed on the above blockchain network. In the smart contract, node A is the owner of the Auction. Node B and Node C place their bids but those transaction are private and only visible to the Node A. This is the feature of Quorum blockchain which allows to do private transactions.

We are using web3j-quorum library which is an extension to web3j providing support for JP Morgan's Quorum API.

### This project reuses code from the [quorum-examples](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples/blob/master/README.md) and the setup steps are similar
